# Analyzing Global Temperature Trends from 1995 to 2019: A Data Science Journey
# Introduction
In this data analysis project, we delve into the intriguing world of global temperatures spanning from 1995 to 2019. Our journey involves data cleaning, visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning modeling to uncover insights and trends in temperature patterns across different regions and cities.

# Data Preparation
We start by importing necessary libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Plotly, and TensorFlow for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling. Our dataset, sourced from city_temperature.csv, contains temperature records from various cities worldwide.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Our EDA phase begins with identifying and handling duplicates and missing values in the dataset. We visualize the average temperature distribution using box plots and explore trends over time using line plots and heatmaps.

# Regional Temperature Trends
We investigate how average temperatures vary across different regions globally. Using interactive widgets, we compare temperature trends in Africa, Asia, Australia/South Pacific, Europe, Middle East, North America, and South/Central America & Caribbean.

# Extreme Temperature Records
We highlight the highest and lowest recorded temperatures, showcasing Kuwait's scorching 110°F in 2012 and Fairbanks' freezing -50°F in 1999.

# Countrywise Analysis
Utilizing choropleth maps, we visualize average temperatures in countries over the years, identifying the top coldest and hottest nations.

# City Focus: Mumbai, India
We zoom into Mumbai's temperature trends from 1995 to 2019, examining daily averages, rolling means, and seasonal decompositions.

# Machine Learning: LSTM Model
Our forecasting journey begins with implementing an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to predict future temperature trends. We train the model using data up to 2019 and forecast temperatures for 2020.

# Seasonal ARIMA Model
In parallel, we employ a Seasonal ARIMA model to analyze monthly temperature trends, providing insights into the first few months of 2020.

# Conclusion
Our comprehensive analysis not only uncovers historical temperature patterns but also predicts future trends, offering valuable insights for climate researchers, policymakers, and the general public.
